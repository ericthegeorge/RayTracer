This Ray Tracer is designed to demonstrate how ray tracing works at a basic level. 
Starting from the direction of simulated light, to different refraction and reflection rates by material, different shapes and objects, external cameras, glass, and aperture level focusing. 
Created under the guidance of Carson Cheng, my excellent high school teacher of Computer Science 30/31 AP, by Eric George (Owner)
